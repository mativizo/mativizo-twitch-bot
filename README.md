Mativizo Twitch Bot ü§ñ - WIP!

This is Twitch Bot prepared especially for my streams [Mativizo on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mativizo), but you can use it if you feel like it's worth it. I'm streaming in polish, but if you want to say hello, you're more than welcome! üòÖ


## .env file
You can change language (and other settings) in .env file:

```
# Your bot account Twitch Auth Token
TWITCH_AUTH_TOKEN=oauth:ABCDE12345

# Your bot account Twitch username
TWITCH_USERNAME=BOTUSERNAME

# Your own Twitch username
TWITCH_TARGET_CHANNEL=MYUSERNAME

# Language (pl or en)
LANG=pl

# Commands prefix
PREFIX=!
```

## Setup

Still work in progress.

1. Go to [https://twitchapps.com/tmi/](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) and generate OAuth.
2. Setup `.env` file.
3. Install packages with `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Enjoy your streams! ‚ù§

## Commands

In progress:
- `!cmds`/`!commands` - showing commands on screen.

## Overlays

Todo.

#### How can say "thank you"?

Come to live stream, leave a star ‚≠ê on this repo or simply add some info about author! 

Remember, however, that it is not required. üòä
